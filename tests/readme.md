# Tests Directory

This folder contains **intentionally failing tests** as part of TDD (Task 3.1).

The failures (NameError on missing functions) are expected and desired — they define the "empty slots" that AI agents must eventually fill.

Run with:
uv run pytest tests/

Current status (Feb 05, 2026): 3 failed, 1 passed → correct red phase.
